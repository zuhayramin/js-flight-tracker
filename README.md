# Flight Tracker Widget

The purpose of this project was to learn how to incorporate node.js into a javascript project

The API used for this project was the Hong Kong International Airport API from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/don.ling.lok/api/flight-information-of-hong-kong-international-airport/)

I used the express module, which is a web application framework for Node.js. It allows you to build web applications and APIs easily.I also had to implement the cors module, to avoid the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing errors when using external APIs.

## To use this application
1.Download the applciation files

2.Open terminal and move to the directory containing the application files

3.Run ```npm start``` to run the local server which retrieved the flight data from the API

4.Open the 'html' file in the 'clients' folder
